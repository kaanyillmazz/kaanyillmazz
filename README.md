### Hi, I'm Kaan ðŸ‘‹

 A software developer from Turkey :)


I am studying computer science at Ã–zyeÄŸin University as a 4th year student.
The technologies I often use are React and Java.
I am also familiar with C, C++, Verilog,
Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS,
Bootstrap, Redux, MaterialUI,
Node.js and Spring Boot.
I am very interested in learning
new technologies, also ask me anything :)

I'm currently working on CTRL + Future Bootcamp.
